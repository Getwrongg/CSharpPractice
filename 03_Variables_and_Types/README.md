# Variables and Types

In this topic you learn how C# stores information. Variables are like labelled boxes, and the type system tells you what can go inside each box. Understanding this concept keeps your programs reliable and reduces surprises.

You'll cover:
- Declaring variables with clear names and appropriate types.
- Differentiating between value types (like `int`) and reference types (like `string`).
- Using type inference (`var`) responsibly.

These skills connect directly to **Conditionals**, **Loops**, and **Methods**, where you'll manipulate data and make decisions based on variable values.

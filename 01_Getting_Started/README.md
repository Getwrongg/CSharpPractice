# Getting Started with C#

Welcome! This section sets the scene for what C# is, where it lives, and how you'll be using it throughout this learning journey. We'll unpack the basic building blocks such as the .NET ecosystem, development tools, and how a simple C# application is organised. Think of this as learning the layout of the workshop before you pick up the tools.

By the end you'll be comfortable with:
- Describing what C# is used for in Aussie industries.
- Setting up your development environment on Windows machines commonly used in TAFE labs.
- Reading the skeleton of a basic C# program and knowing what each part is called.

You'll see every idea from this section pop up again later, especially when we dive into syntax and program structure in the next topic.

# Common Mistakes When Getting Started

- **Skipping the tooling setup** – jumping straight into coding without checking .NET SDK versions can lead to confusing compiler errors later.
- **Ignoring namespaces** – leaving out `using` statements or not understanding namespaces makes future topics like classes and collections harder to digest.
- **Copying code blindly** – pasting sample programs without checking each keyword slows down learning. Try narrating what every part of the skeleton does.

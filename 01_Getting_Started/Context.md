# Why Getting Started Matters

Before writing any C# code, you need to understand the environment it lives in. C# runs on the .NET platform, which looks after things like memory management, libraries, and the compiler. Knowing this upfront helps you make sense of later topics like namespaces and classes because you'll know who is in charge under the hood.

In real workplaces, developers rarely start from scratch. They inherit projects, set up workstations, and join existing teams. This topic mirrors that experience by showing you how to prepare your tools and understand the moving parts. When you reach topics like **Syntax and Structure** and **Methods**, you'll already recognise the standard pieces because you've met them here.

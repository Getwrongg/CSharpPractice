# C# Learning Journey

This repository maps out a structured, TAFE-friendly pathway for learning C# from the ground up. Work through the numbered folders in order:

1. `01_Getting_Started`
2. `02_Syntax_and_Structure`
3. `03_Variables_and_Types`
4. `04_Conditionals`
5. `05_Loops`
6. `06_Methods`
7. `07_Classes_and_Objects`
8. `08_Inheritance_and_Polymorphism`
9. `09_Collections`
10. `10_Error_Handling`
11. `11_File_IO`
12. `12_Best_Practices`

Each topic folder contains:

- **README.md** – a plain-language explainer of the concept.
- **Context.md** – why the idea matters and where it appears in real programs.
- **Syntax_Notes.md** – the shape and meaning of relevant syntax without full code listings.
- **Common_Mistakes.md** (when needed) – traps beginners can avoid.

Start at `01_Getting_Started` and move down the numbered folders. Every section highlights how the ideas connect so you can build a solid foundation before jumping into full projects.

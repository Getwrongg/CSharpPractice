## Practice Challenges
1. **Difficulty 1 (Easy):** Count how many steps someone takes during a short walk by adding one step for each pace they report.
2. **Difficulty 2:** Ask a user for their top five songs and list them back in the order they were entered.
3. **Difficulty 3:** Keep track of weekly savings contributions until a target amount is reached, then let the saver know how many weeks it took.
4. **Difficulty 4:** Rotate through customer support tickets, skipping any that are already resolved, until all open issues have been reviewed.
5. **Difficulty 5 (Intermediate):** Process sensor readings in batches, stopping early if three faulty readings show up in a row while still reporting how many valid readings were handled.

# Why Syntax and Structure Matter

C# is a strongly typed, compiled language. The compiler needs strict instructions to transform your text into executable programs. Syntax rules act like road signs: follow them and the compiler knows exactly what to do; ignore them and everything stops.

Understanding the structure lets you read other people's code. When you join a team or look at open-source projects, you rely on these consistent patterns. Later, when you design **Methods** or manage **Error Handling**, the syntax rules you learn here will help you place code in the right spot and communicate intent clearly.

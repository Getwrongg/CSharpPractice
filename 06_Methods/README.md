## Overview
This section will unpack the key ideas for methods in simple language. Content will be added as the learning pathway is expanded.

## Context
Details about why this concept matters and where it appears in real programs will be documented here.

## Syntax Outline
Structured syntax guidance for this topic will appear here. No executable code will be included.

## Common Mistakes
Frequent pitfalls and tips for avoiding them will be recorded here once the topic is drafted.

## Practice Challenges
1. **Difficulty 1 (Easy):** Describe a method that takes someone’s name and politely greets them, returning the full greeting message.
2. **Difficulty 2:** Plan a method that receives the price of an item and a discount percentage, then gives back the discounted price.
3. **Difficulty 3:** Outline a method that accepts a list of daily temperatures and returns the average, making sure it handles empty lists sensibly.
4. **Difficulty 4:** Sketch a method that validates a new user’s password by checking length, the presence of numbers, and whether it matches a confirmation entry.
5. **Difficulty 5 (Intermediate):** Design a set of helper methods that together manage a to-do list—adding tasks, marking them complete, and generating a summary of what’s left.
